My final project for The Iron Yard:

	Jot is an app for writers to organize their ideas. All too often, writers (myself, included) have journals and sticky notes filled with ideas and musings, but in the chaos of it all, they are never seen again. This app takes the workflow of the writer's idea process and puts it on the web, making organization and storage easy! Individual ideas live on stickies in the Idea Board. Journaling occurs in Journals (shocking), and the real magic happens when you create a Project. Once a writer decides on a play or novel or other future literary masterpiece, he/she creates a Project. Here is where you take the ideas/journals that you have been creating and organize them.


	The components:

		The Idea Board:
			This is where your sticky notes live. Here, you can create new stickies, delete, edit, drag them around your screen to help create a visual of your workflow and, if desired, drag the drop a sticky into a project that you have created. 

		Journals:
			Organized much like a blog, this is where the writer can rant, ramble and write anything and everything. If something is good or inspires a project you have in mind, drag and drop it into a Project!

		Projects:
			These are collections of Ideas and Journals. Cool!
